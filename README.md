## üìò Overview

This project implements a simulation framework for **LLM-based generative agents** with **structured memory architectures**, designed to evaluate how different memory types (episodic, semantic, and procedural) impact an agent‚Äôs behavior over a 14-day virtual environment.

The goal is to equip LLM-powered agents with **human-like memory recall**, **planning**, and **causal reasoning**, addressing one of the key weaknesses of LLMs ‚Äî **lack of persistent memory**.

## üß† Core Concepts

The system uses a **three-layer memory architecture**:
- `sensory_memory.json`: short-term sensory inputs (FIFO)
- `short_term_memory.json`: filtered significant events
- `long_term_memory.json`: deeply relevant, identity-aligned experiences

Supported memory types:
- **Episodic Memory:** Personal experiences and events
- **Semantic Memory:** General facts and knowledge
- **Procedural Memory:** Routines and behavioral patterns

Each memory type is tested independently.


## üß™ Simulation Process

- Runs for **14 simulated days**, with each hour = 1 tick (336 ticks total)
- At each tick:
  - Agent executes a main event from the daily plan
  - `event.py` injects subevents if main event match
  - Events are stored in sensory memory ‚Üí filtered ‚Üí promoted to long/short-term memory
- Planning is influenced by memories and updated dynamically
- Periodic memory-based plan reflection occurs every 12 ticks

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

The agent is evaluated on:
- **Memory Accuracy:** 30 factual recall questions scored with BLEU
- **Causal Reasoning:** 10 questions scored using cosine similarity + LLM validation
- **Total Score:** 0.8 √ó Memory Accuracy + 0.2 √ó Causal Reasoning

> Results indicate **episodic memory** performs best in long-term recall.

## üìå Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Launches the full simulation |
| `memory.py` | Initializes agent with specified memory type |
| `plan.py` | Manages daily and weekly plans |
| `event.py` | Handles event injection and matching |
| `systemrole.txt` | Defines agent‚Äôs personality |
| `fixed_subevent.json` | Stores environment up coming for events |
| `*_memory.json` | Track and log different types of agent memory |
| `*_results.json` | Output of BLEU and similarity scoring |
| `graph.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook to visualize results |

## üìà Sample Result

Example question:
    Q: Who are your teammates in your algorithm class?
    A: Brian, David, and Jasmine.
    Reference: Tom, Brian, Chris, and Alex
    BLEU Score: 0.0098
Even partial matches receive low BLEU scores, showing the challenge of memory precision.

## üîÆ Future Work

- Introduce **abstraction** and **summarization** of memories
- Scale to **semester-long simulations**
- Expand to **multi-agent environments** for social memory
- Evaluate **human-likeness** of behaviors with GPT judges
